# create-Unique-Project-README
## Project Description
This project revolved around using *node.js* and node modules such as *inquirer* to further our knowledge of Javascript and to take our first steps into the backend realm. The project accepts user input from the command line and uses this to populate a professional README.md file for the user to use as they please.

## Installation
Before running the program, you must download the following dependencies:
<div style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); vertical-align: middle; padding:10px 20px; border-radius: 10px">
npm i inquirer@8.2.4
</div>

## Usage
To run the code, type *node index.js* in the command line of the root directory. The command line will prompt you a series of questions necessary to create a functional README.md. Some inquiries are required and the code will not proceed without them. The license inquiry does not allow more than one license to be selected. Once everything is input, the finished README.md file is written to the dist directory.
